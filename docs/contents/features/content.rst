Quoi? Feur
==========

The bot continuously monitors every channel and checks wether there is an
occurence of "feur" in a message. If so, it will reply with the infamous
"feur" french joke. The best part is that it will not answer "feur" alone,
but try to make a sentence out of it, using the message context.
For this, it uses a simple process which can be looked at in the ``src/handle_quoi.py``
